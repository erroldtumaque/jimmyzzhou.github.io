												<h4>Heroics</h4>
												<h5><b>Roles: Designer, User Researcher, Project Manager</b></h5>
												<p>Made with a team of 5. Heroics is a Dungeons and Dragons-like board game with linear grid combat system. I designed it around the question, “What would an adventuring party actually look like if you recruited people from a tavern wall to ransack a dungeon for treasure?” It turns out, pretty awful.</p>
												
											</div>
										</article>
										<p><p>The development and testing period for this game ran for around 16 weeks. I ran tests on the game 4 separate times, initially using utilizing usability tests for the first 3 
													sessions and then a larger scale play test for the final session. Each test was recorded with the permission of the users and then analyzed using content analysis to pick out
													details of the game that players struggled with but did not mention. It also established a consistent environment for us to work with, so that if we ever
													transitioned to a new location to run the exact same test with the same structure, it would be simple to determine outside factors. <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/secret/xIuKXrr3rWxOmR">Here</a> are the final playtest notes I aggregated to present to the team.</p>
										<p>Players design characters for others to play, with one personality quirk that they have to follow and roleplay, such as constantly having to flirt with teammates or making "gotta go fast" puns. The combat system and board set-up ensures that they constantly work with and against each other, backstabbing at what they might think are key moments. Death in the game just allows players to control the monsters and break off pieces of the board to rearrange players. I’ve attached a link to the instruction booklet <a href="images/Heroics.pdf">here</a>.</p>

												<h4>Cucuvaeua</h4>
												<h5><b>Roles: User Researcher, Designer, Project Manager</b></h5>
												<p id="cucuvaeua">Made with a team of 3. Cucuvaeua is a text based adventure game that attempted to psychologically profile gamers and use survey responses to predict actions and immersion levels in a text based game.</p>
				
											</div>
										</article>
										<p>Players went through a series of difficult choices to make based on either self-preservation or charity, with selfless actions costing you resources. Game development took quite a while in order to make sure that each scenario could answer the questions we had about gamers and whether or not actions could be emphasized to appeal to different types. The survey is available by request.</p>
										<p I recruited a usability expert who was able to analyze the game under the PLAY heuristics which we walked through together. We did this twice: once when the game was first completed, and once more after revisions based on think-alouds that I ran along the way. I ran 5 different think-aloud sessions with different members within the computational media and computer science departments.</p>

												<h4>Astaire</h4>
												<h5><b>Roles: User Researcher, Designer, Project Manager</b></h5>
												<p>I am currently working with 10 other people. Astaire is a co-located social virtual reality game that focuses on asymmetrical gameplay utilizing one VR system.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
				
										<p>Astaire's interesting from a designer and user researcher standpoint. First, how do I design from 3 different perspectives to make sure the audience, player inside VR, and player outside of VR all enjoy the experience? Secondly, how would I test this effectively? These thoughts led to the current iteration of the game, where the player inside VR has a controller strapped to their wrist and touches musical notes to get points, while the person outside of VR has a controller strapped to their leg with the same objective. The person outside of VR has more information, with an overhead map that shows notes before they appear.
											
											I've done preliminary usability testing on the HTC Vive <a href="images/HTCViveReport.pdf">(linked here)</a> to understand aspects of the hardware might take away from the game, and am currently using the results adjust the design process. <a href="images/AstaireUpdateDec2017.pdf">Here's an example of one of the reports I've written for the team.</a> I’m applying IDEO human-centered design methods to tackle physical and virtual limitations. It’s in progress right now, but there should be a prototype of the game done by May 2018. Any further design and data documents are available by request.</p>

												<h4>Emotional Chatbots and Gender</h4>
												<h5><b>Roles: User Researcher</b></h5>
												<p>I worked in a team of 3 to decipher differences in desires and perceptions of chatbots between males and females.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<p>We designed survey questions revolving around human-like and emotional chatbots and sent them out to 25 people, all within a certain age range and familiar with chatbots. We couldn't confidently say, using a Chi-square analysis, that there were any significant differences between genders towards preferences for emotional audio and textual chatbots. However, qualitative analysis and coding the answers showed
											far more interesting results in that emotions in audio and textual chatbots were contextualized differently despite clarification. For example, many people wanted emotional, textual chatbots, but they did not want the chatbots to talk like a human (e.g. using slang, emoticons, etc.) 
											which leads to more questions about how people really define emotion within these bots. <a href="images/GenderChatbotEmotions.pdf">Our breakdown report is linked here.</a></p>

												<h4>Unreal and Unity Games</h4>
												<p>I’ve designed a few games in Unity and Unreal, mainly to practice coding and utilizing the tools. I never named them or really brought them to a point where I felt they were finished, but these games are available on request as well.</p>
