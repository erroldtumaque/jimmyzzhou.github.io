												<h4>Heroics</h4>
												<h5><b>Roles: Designer, User Researcher, Project Manager</b></h5>
												<p>Made with a team of 5. Heroics is a Dungeons and Dragons-like board game with linear grid combat system. I designed it around the question, “What would an adventuring party actually look like if you recruited people from a tavern wall to ransack a dungeon for treasure?” It turns out, pretty awful.</p>
												
											</div>
										</article>
										<p><p>The development and testing period for this game ran for around 16 weeks. I ran tests on the game 4 separate times, initially using utilizing usability tests for the first 3 
													sessions and then a larger scale play test for the final session. Each test was recorded with the permission of the users and then analyzed using content analysis to pick out
													details of the game that players struggled with but did not mention. It also established a consistent environment for us to work with, so that if we ever
													transitioned to a new location to run the exact same test with the same structure, it would be simple to determine outside factors. <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/secret/xIuKXrr3rWxOmR">Here</a> are the final playtest notes I aggregated to present to the team.</p>
										<p>Players design characters for others to play, with one personality quirk that they have to follow and roleplay, such as constantly having to flirt with teammates or making "gotta go fast" puns. The combat system and board set-up ensures that they constantly work with and against each other, backstabbing at what they might think are key moments. Death in the game just allows players to control the monsters and break off pieces of the board to rearrange players. I’ve attached a link to the instruction booklet <a href="images/Heroics.pdf">here</a>.</p>

												<h4>Cucuvaeua</h4>
												<h5><b>Roles: User Researcher, Designer, Project Manager</b></h5>
												<p id="cucuvaeua">Made with a team of 3. Cucuvaeua is a text based adventure game that attempted to psychologically profile gamers and use survey responses to predict actions and immersion levels in a text based game.</p>

										<p>Players went through a series of difficult choices to make based on either self-preservation or charity, with selfless actions costing you resources. Game development took quite a while in order to make sure that each scenario could answer the questions we had about gamers and whether or not actions could be emphasized to appeal to different types. The survey is available by request.</p>
										<p I recruited a usability expert who was able to analyze the game under the PLAY heuristics which we walked through together. We did this twice: once when the game was first completed, and once more after revisions based on think-alouds that I ran along the way. I ran 5 different think-aloud sessions with different members within the computational media and computer science departments.</p>

												<h4>Astaire</h4>
												<h5><b>Roles: User Researcher, Designer, Project Manager</b></h5>
												<p>I am currently working with 10 other people. My current project is a co-located social virtual reality game that focuses on asymmetrical gameplay utilizing one VR system.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<p>Typically, only one person can play a VR game, with very few exceptions, so I decided to try to design a game that allows people not wearing the headset to also enjoy the gameplay. I've done preliminary usability testing on the HTC Vive to understand aspects of the hardware might take away from the game, and am currently using the results adjust the design process. I’m applying IDEO human-centered design methods to tackle physical and virtual limitations. It’s in progress right now, but there should be a prototype of the game done by March 2018. Current design, update, and data documents are available by request.</p>

												<h4>Unreal and Unity Games</h4>
												<p>I’ve designed multiple games in Unity and Unreal Engine 4, using both to create anything from basic shooters, to simple models of worlds, to large scale maze games using procedural generation. Each of these games were small projects I attempted in my spare time while studying in preparation for my Master’s degree and were not given names upon completion. </p>
